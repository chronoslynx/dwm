dwm - dynamic window manager
============================
dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.

This is a personal "fork" of dwm. I have a small number of additional features
patched in:

* new getstatus() function that supports inverting from norm -> sel drawing
  on a particular invert delimeter.
* increased padding on the bar
* modified drawsquare function
* gaplessgrid
* push
* pull to master (toggleview)
* bstack (no bstackhoriz yet)
