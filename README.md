# dwm - dynamic window manager
dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.

This is a personal "fork" of dwm. I have a small number of additional features
patched in:

* pango (this allows for status colors using pango's internal markup)
* increased padding on the bar
* modified drawsquare function
* push
* pull to master (toggleview)
* bstack/bstackhoriz
* uselessgaps
* gaplessgrid (with decent support for uselessgaps, but it's not perfect)
* centerclock


### TODO
* ~~gaplessgrid~~
* ~~uselessgaps for gaplessgrid~~
* Fix for time not getting updated on both monitors simultaneously
* Fix for statusbar stripping trailing whitespace / move statusbar in from monitor edge
